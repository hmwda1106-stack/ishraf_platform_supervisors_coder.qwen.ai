# Backend Wave 1 Status

This file is the backend-authoritative reference before the first frontend wave starts. If older academic documents disagree with the current codebase, the code and this file are the source of truth for Wave 1.

## Architecture Decision

- Current architecture: `modular monolith`
- This is an intentional Wave 1 release decision, not a microservices split
- Domain boundaries are enforced through modules, services, repositories, ownership helpers, reporting, and automation layers

## Hosted Staging Reference

- Public root URL: `https://ishraf-platform-backend-staging.onrender.com`
- Public API base URL: `https://ishraf-platform-backend-staging.onrender.com/api/v1`
- Runtime database provider: `Neon Postgres`
- Runtime database connections are controlled by env only:
  - `DATABASE_URL`
  - `DATABASE_URL_MIGRATIONS`
  - `DATABASE_SCHEMA=public`
  - `PUBLIC_ROOT_URL`
  - `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`

## Canonical Data Model Decisions

These points resolve the old-document vs implementation mismatch:

- Attendance is not modeled as a single operational table anymore
  - Canonical model: `attendance_sessions` + `attendance`
- Exams and grades are not the primary assessment model anymore
  - Canonical model: `assessment_types` + `assessments` + `student_assessments`
- Subjects are not semester-scoped directly
  - Canonical model: `subjects` + `subject_offerings`
- Behavior does not store category semantics inline only
  - Canonical model: `behavior_categories` + `behavior_records`
- Transport operations are not reduced to a single trip entity
  - Canonical model: `trips` + `bus_location_history` + `trip_student_events`
- The current backend also includes higher-order operational layers:
  - `reporting`
  - `automation`
  - `profile resolution`
  - `ownership enforcement`

## Ready Backend Modules

The following backend modules are ready or close enough for frontend Wave 1:

- `auth`
- `users`
- `academic-structure`
- `students`
- `attendance`
- `assessments`
- `behavior`
- `transport`
- `communication`
- `reporting`
- `homework`

### Supervisor

- behavior operations within allowed scope
- attendance read/update within allowed scope
- supervisor dashboard
- student reporting access for assigned classes

### Driver

- recurring route assignment discovery
- ensure-daily trip flow
- transport trip flows within current ownership enforcement
- trip student roster endpoint for operational pickup/drop-off flows
- transport summary scoped to driver-owned trips
- communication notifications/messages allowed for the role
- recipients directory endpoint for message compose flows

## Gaps Closed Before Frontend Wave 1

These frontend blockers are now closed in the backend:

- `Homework Module`
- parent-owned student detail/report surfaces
- parent transport live status endpoint
- supervisor dashboard
- forgot/reset password flows
- login rate limiting
- test database bootstrap/reset strategy
- cross-module notifications automation
- security/runtime hardening for staging deploy
- Render + Neon deployment assets and env templates

## Not In Wave 1

These are explicitly deferred and are not blockers for frontend Wave 1:

- Firebase / FCM / realtime transport
- Google Maps / ETA
- AI analytics
- 2FA
- advanced system settings
- CSV import unless school onboarding pressure makes it necessary later

The `microservices` wording in older documents is a historical architecture note, not an active execution item before frontend Wave 1.

## Operational Notes For Frontend

- All `id` values are returned as `string`
- All responses use the same envelope: `success`, `message`, `data` or `errors`
- Paginated list endpoints return:
  - `data.items`
  - `data.pagination`
- Some feeds also include `unreadCount`
- Parent access is ownership-based and should never assume unrestricted `studentId` access
- Transport source-of-truth is:
  - `routes`
  - `transport_route_assignments`
  - `bus_stops`
  - `student_bus_assignments`
  - `trips`
  - `trip_student_events`
- Student textual address is not the transport routing source of truth in Wave 1
- Student home location is now supported as a reference/approved location layer, but:
  - it does not replace assigned stop operationally
  - driver daily flow should start from route assignments, then `ensure-daily`
- Real ETA is not part of Wave 1; parent transport live status is based on the current assignment, active trip, last known location, and recent trip events
- auth login, forgot-password, and reset-password are rate-limited
- in hosted staging, forgot-password responses must not assume `resetToken` is returned
- hosted staging target is Render + Neon, documented in `src/docs/DEPLOY_RENDER_NEON.md`
- admin reporting and student-scoped contract alignment is documented in:
  - `src/docs/frontend-execution/admin-dashboard/ATTENDANCE_BEHAVIOR_ROUTE_ALIGNMENT.md`

## Recommended Frontend Start Order

1. Admin dashboard and admin auth flows
2. User, academic-structure, and student management
3. Daily operational screens: attendance, assessments, behavior, homework
4. Parent dashboard and parent app flows
5. Teacher dashboard and teacher app flows
6. Driver transport flows and transport visibility surfaces
